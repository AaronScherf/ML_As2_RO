README for implementing code for ML Assignment 2
Aaron Scherf

The ipynb file located at https://github.com/AaronScherf/ML_As2_RO/blob/main/ML_As2_RO.ipynb can be implemented simply by downloading it and running all code.

The pip installs at the beginning should install the appropriate versions of both joblib (1.2.0) and mlrose (the mlrose_hiive branch). If these are already installed, first uninstall the existing versions by uncommenting the pip uninstall commands.

The dataset used for the neural network in part 2 is publicly available on my github at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaronScherf/ML_As1_SL/main/housing.csv

Both part 1 and part 2 should execute automatically to produce all tables and figures from the report, with appropriate random seed settings to ensure reproducibility.
